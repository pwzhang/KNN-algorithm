# KNN-algorithm
Using KNN to classify

Before running KNN_Nearest.py, please change the path in the code to where to put the file 'crx.data'.
I wrote comments in the .py file, if you have questions please contact me
After several attempt, I found when k = 7, the correct rate is highest in this case.

Categories in each line are listed in the file crx.names
